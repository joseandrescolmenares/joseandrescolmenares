 ## ‚öí my projects:
 
 - [Proyecto Country](https://client-rose-phi.vercel.app/)
 
 ![proyecto Country](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70913085/174387005-56228ac8-1fb6-4490-99a1-14f9ec3d59d6.png)
 it is a SPA (Single Page Application) using React for the Front Ent and Redux as state management. All components were developed with CSS without external library.
the SPA consumes data from an API https://spoonacular.com/ through a Back End developed in Node.js using Express, adding new features to the original API.
Some features of the project: Search cache, sorting and filters, controlled forms for creating recipes.


- [Finder](https://finder-app-omega.vercel.app/)

Finder is an application that makes it easy for you to find people who offer a service and also helps people who are looking for a job.
This application was carried out in a team where we implemented the Scrum methodology
